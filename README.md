# truchettiles

## Description

This project is an implementation of [truchet tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles). This is implemented using the Canvas element. The purpose of this project is to create a template for interactive truchet tile backgrounds that could be used in web projects. You can access a demo at [johnprovazek.com/truchettiles](https://www.johnprovazek.com/truchettiles/). 

Built using vanilla JavaScript utilizing the Canvas element.

## Installation

To utilize this project place a `<canvas>` element with the id "truchettiles" within the body of your html file. Include the files *truchettiles.js* and *truchettiles.css* in your html file. You will also need to include the appropriate image files. This project is built assuming the body has a margin of 0 and the height and width are at 100vw and 100vh. You may need to make some adjustments to your project to get this to work.

## Usage

The plan is to have a page to sample different truchet tile configurations and you can download a json file with the configuration.

## Bugs & Improvements

- Add new truchet tile designs.
- Add smooth transitions between tiles.
- Add a configuration option.

## License

No License for now until I have a better understanding of this. Would like this to be free for non commercial use.
