# truchettiles

## Description

This project is an implementation of [truchet tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truchet_tiles). This is implemented using the `<canvas>` element. The purpose of this project is to create a template for interactive truchet tile backgrounds that could be used in web projects. You can access a demo at [johnprovazek.com/truchettiles](https://www.johnprovazek.com/truchettiles/). This project is currently in the early stages of development. 

Built using vanilla JavaScript utilizing the `<canvas>` element.

## Installation

To utilize this project in it's current state place a `<canvas>` element with the id "truchettiles" within the body of your html file. Include the files *truchettiles.js* and *truchettiles.css* in your html file. You will also need to include the appropriate image files. This project is built assuming the body has a margin of 0 and the height and width are at 100vw and 100vh. You may need to make some adjustments to your project to get this to work. The future plan is to have a page to sample different truchet tile configurations and you can download a JSON file with the configuration.

## Usage

Interact with the `<canvas>` with your mouse to change the orientation of the tiles.

## Bugs & Improvements

- Add new truchet tile designs.
- Add smooth transitions between tiles.
- Add a configuration option.
